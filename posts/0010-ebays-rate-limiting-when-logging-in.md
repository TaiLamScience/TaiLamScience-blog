# 10: eBay's rate-limiting when logging in

eBay is sometimes tedious to deal with.  I use the site to buy electronic parts for repair, but some
aspects of the site are a bit annoying to deal with.<!--more-->

For example, if you use a password manager, then you should wait a few seconds (about 5 seconds or
more , if I had to name a number) before submitting your password.  (Then, you will be prompted with
an SMS verification, if you are using a VPN.)

I received an error message, described identically in an EcommerceBytes
[article](https://www.ecommercebytes.com/2021/01/15/ebay-thwarts-shoppers-it-says-are-searching-too-fast/)
from January 2021.  I think this was because I tried to log in very quickly, with the help of my
password manager.

This YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVc6rzI0Fxw) from August 2023 also shows the
rate limiting.

This is sort of annoying, as I wanted to check the status of my item shipping, since now even the
U.S. Postal Service completely blocks access to its site via VPNs, as I tried doing this about two
days ago.
