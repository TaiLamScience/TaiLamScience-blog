# 9: Virgo laptop from System76

There probably hasn't been much concrete and confirmed info about the upcoming Virgo laptop from
System76.  There's some more, but I wanted to get into the basics, and then I can follow up later,
as this will be out of date anyways once Virgo is officially released.<!--more-->

Louis Rossmann made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4KoUAW3kyI) on Virgo in mid-July
2023.  However, not all the details he discussed was correct, according to paper.  Whatever
applicable software and firmware will be using GPLv3, but the hardware will be using the strongly
reciprocal version of the CERN Open Hardware Licence (CERN-OHL-S).

Bryan Lunduke also made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGxOcUynqwk) about Virgo in late
July 2023.  Lunduke's reporting had more accurate details.  (Yes, I know Lunduke has gone off the
deep end, but he is one of the few people online who can accurately report on Virgo.)

Virgo's project files can be found on System76's GitHub [repo](https://github.com/system76/virgo/).

There hasn't been much activity since 2023.  I suppose it's because System76 has preparing to
release its Rust-based [COSMIC](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-epoch) desktop environment (DE) in
2024.  The alpha should be released in August 2024... is it August 8th?  (I believe this is true?
However, I can't seem to find the date anymore.  Maybe I should listen to [episode 10](https://system76.transistor.fm/10)
of the System76 podcast...)
