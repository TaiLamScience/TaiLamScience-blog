# 6: GitHub blocks aliases from SimpleLogin, Proton Pass, & Erine Mail
_Originally collected on July 9, 2024_

Recently I had to create new GitHub accounts, and the process is not great for privacy and security,
because Microsoft automatically disables/flags any new account created in July 2024 or
later.<!--more-->

Here are some links corroborating SimpleLogin alias domain blocking:

* Reddit
    * A [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Simplelogin/comments/11lcdr3/github_flagged_by_account_because_i_used_a/) from March 2023
    * A [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Simplelogin/comments/12tlle5/github_account_flagged_for_simplelogin_address) from April 2024
* This GitHub community discussion [thread](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/54128) from May 2023
* Bonus: I doubt spamgourmet aliases can be used to create new GitHub accounts, as SimpleLogin wrote a blog [post](https://simplelogin.io/blog/spamgourmet/) about [spamgourmet](https://www.spamgourmet.com/index.pl) in January 2020

I have received similar results when using all current alias domains available on [Proton Pass](https://proton.me/pass)
and [Erine Mail](https://erine.email/).  Proton Pass last worked in early June 2024, but stopped
working in early July 2024.  Also, although I'm not sure when Erine Mail last worked, but it also
became blocked in early July 2024.
