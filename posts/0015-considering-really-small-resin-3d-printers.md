# Considering really small resin 3D printers

_This was originally written on November 7, 2025._

So I was wondering about 3D resin printing, as I saw a [video](https://youtu.be/3u0idTuaJSo) from 3D
Printing Nerd.

(Random: I think Joel of 3D Printing Nerd is basically like Markiplier in 3D printing, with some of
Mark's hyperactivity toned down.)<!--more-->

## Some thoughts

So, I've seen the acronym SLA, which is associated with resin 3D printing, which comes from
[stereolithography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography).

I was interested in the [TinyMaker](https://tinymaker3d.com/), which was the very small resin 3D
printer showcased in the video.  There was initially a Kickstarter crowdfunding
[campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tinymaker/tinymaker-3d-printer/description), and
then a continued open-end timeline
[campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/en/projects/tinymaker/tinymaker-open-source-3d-printer--2) on
IndieGoGo.

The video mentioned that the TinyMaker files are available, and TinyMaker states that it is open
source hardware.  However, I had no luck finding the files, at least easily.  The only result I
found was this GitHub [repository](http://github.com/impakho/TinyMaker), which was last active in
2018.

Currently I'm a bit wary, as some backers are only recently receiving the TinyMaker 2 years after
the campaign ended.  Yes, I know there's an inherent risk with crowdfunding.  So, I'll wait until
TinyMaker reaches steady public availability.

### Alternatives: maybe just get a "normal" sized resin printer?

I might as well consider the currently only
[option](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-sl1s-speed-3d-printer-cw1s-bundle/) from
Prusa for consumers: the Original Prusa SL1S SPEED 3D Printer and CW1S (cure and wash station)
bundle.

There is a MSLA (masked SLA) [printer](https://www.prusa3d.com/applications/prusa-pro-slx_236051/)
from Prusa: Prusa Pro SLX.  However, that looks like a professional industrial machine, and it is
still "coming soon" (as of November 2025).

## Conclusion

Currently, a comparable product is the Lite3DP Gen 2, which is available on
[Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/lite3dp/lite3dp-gen-2).
