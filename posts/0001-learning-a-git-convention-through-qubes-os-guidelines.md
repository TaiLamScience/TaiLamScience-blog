# 1: Learning a Git convention through Qubes OS guidelines

I am adapting correspondence to blog post form.<!--more-->

I learned a lot (over time, not immediately) by following the "Commit message guidelines"
[section](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/coding-style/#commit-message-guidelines) in Qubes OS's coding
style guide (and the whole "Coding style" page in general).

This has really improved my (very minor, mostly non-technical) contributions, and to be prepared for
working with Git at Northeastern's Align Masters program in Cybersecurity in fall 2024.

Some other related documents from Qubes OS are:
* Its [page](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/how-to-edit-the-documentation/) on "How to edit the documentation", and
* Its [page](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/documentation-style-guide/) for "Documentation style guide"

I hope this can be a starting point for guiding other programmers on how to navigate contributing to
open-source projects. Of course, other projects will be different from the Qubes OS project, though
the conceptual procedure is the same: find out if a project has contribution guidelines, and then
follow its ground rules for a smooth, streamlined (hopefully) helpful and productive experience.
