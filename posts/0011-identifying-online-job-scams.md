# 11: Identifying online job scams

About three days ago, I was reading official online sources regarding online job scams.<!--more-->

There is resource [page](https://consumer.ftc.gov/jobs-and-making-money/jobs) from the FTC and a
[page](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/) to report online scams, as well as the the Internet Crime
Complaint Center (IC3) [page](https://www.ic3.gov/) from the FBI.

## Conclusion

Most traditional jobs don't advertise on Craigslist.  I almost got burned, but luckily I kept
looking at the e-mail address (as it was a Yahoo e-mail address, instead of from a company-official
e-mail address from a major American healthcare corporation) until I noticed this, like an animal
that was well camouflaged in its environment.

An offer that's "too good to be true" doesn't have to be hyperbolically and comically exaggerated to
being obvious to be a scam -- it can also be a toned-down, realistic parody.

Also, cross reference and check if an online job listing from an aggregate site from a more official
first-party source, which also includes Indeed, also post the same job position.
