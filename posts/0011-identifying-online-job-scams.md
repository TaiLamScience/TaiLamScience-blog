# 11: Identifying online job scams

About three days ago, I was reading federal government online sources about online job scams.<!--more-->

There is resource [page](https://consumer.ftc.gov/jobs-and-making-money/jobs) from the FTC and
another FTC [page](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/) to report online scams, as well as the the Internet
Crime Complaint Center (IC3) [page](https://www.ic3.gov/) from the FBI.

## Conclusion

Most traditional jobs don't advertise on Craigslist.  I almost got burned, but luckily I smoked this
scam out before I could even apply for it.

The particular one I was looking at struck me as strange, as it has been the only Craigslist posting
(of any type) that didn't use Craigslist's prviate e-mail relay/address option.  Due to this, I kept
looking at the e-mail address (as it was a Yahoo e-mail address, instead of from an official
e-mail address from a real American healthcare corporation) until I realized I was looking at a
scam -- it was very much like looking at a very well camoflauged animal for a long time before
spotting it.

An offer that's "too good to be true" doesn't have to be hyperbolically exaggerated to the point of
being comical and super obvious -- it can also be a toned-down, realistic decoy.

Also, it is a good rule of thumb to cross-reference and check if the same online job listing you've
stumbled upon on an aggregate site (such as Craigslist or Indeed) can be found on a better
first-party source, such as the company website.
