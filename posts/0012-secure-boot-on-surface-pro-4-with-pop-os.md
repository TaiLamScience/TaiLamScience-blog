# 12: Secure Boot on Surface Pro 4 with Pop!\_OS

I think I'm overthinking this.  I think I'll follow the instructions for Secure Boot for the
[Linux Surface](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Secure-Boot) project and see
how that goes.<!--more-->

The GH project's wiki references the following the
[ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot#shim)

Additionally, I came across the following sources:

* Super User [thread](https://superuser.com/questions/1446182/how-to-boot-pop-os-in-uefi-mode-without-disabling-secure-boot-on-my-computer) from Stack Exchange
* GitHub [gist](https://gist.github.com/sudo-panda/11c80b20ff84bc18b5982614f189d5c0) from July 2022
* A blog [post](https://blog.clarence-mesina.com/2022/01/06/secure-boot-pop-os) from January 2022

I haven't been able to sit down and try this -- but expect that this worked if I don't come back to
edit this.
